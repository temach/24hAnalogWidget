24h Analog Clock Widget and Android Wear Face
=============================================

This is a homescreen widget and Android Wear watch face that displays a 12-at-the-top 24 hour analog
clock. Noon is at the top, so that the hour hand mimics the path of the sun.

In addition to the time, it will display when the sun rises/sets for your
current location on the dial.

If you like, you can easily install [The homescreen widget][play] or [The Android Wear
face][playwear] from Google Play.

Permissions
-----------

The sunrise/sunset feature uses the location permission. This will not impact
battery life as it never actively requests location â€” it only uses cached
locations acquired by other apps.
